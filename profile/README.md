OpenMMLab builds the most influential open-source computer vision algorithm system in the deep learning era.
It aims to 1) provide high-quality codebases to reduce the difficulties in algorithm reimplementation; 2) create efficient deployment toolchains targeting a variety of backends and devices; 3) build a solid foundation for computer vision research and development; 4) bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications with full-stack toolchains.

Based on PyTorch, OpenMMLab develops MMEngine to provide universal training and evaluation engine, and MMCV to provide neural network operators and data transforms,
which serves as a foundation of the whole project. Since the initial release in October 2018, OpenMMLab has released 15+ toolboxes that cover 30+ research areas, have implemented 300+ algorithms, and contain 2000+ pre-trained models.
